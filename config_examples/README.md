# Configuration Files Examples

## `default.yaml`
This is the default configuration of the anonymizer. It includes all types and all of their attributes and elements. To write a custom configuration it could be useful to start with the default, removing lines you do not want to change, and keeping the parts that you want to change.

## `patient_only.yaml`
This configuration is an attempt to only anonymizer data directly related to a patient. This includes patient name, date of birth, address, contact information, encounter dates, and any free text.
